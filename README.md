# Bookinfo Service Weaver (Go)

This project is a Go-based reimplementation of the [Bookinfo application](https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/bookinfo/), originally developed to demonstrate microservices with Istio. In this version, all services are translated into idiomatic Go and adapted to run with the [Service Weaver](https://serviceweaver.dev/) framework.

## üß© Architecture

The application consists of four main components:

- **Productpage**: Frontend service that displays product information and aggregates data from the other services.
- **Details**: Provides detailed information about the product.
- **Reviews**: Shows reviews and connects to the ratings service.
- **Ratings**: Provides rating scores for products.

All components are implemented as Service Weaver components and communicate using Go interfaces instead of HTTP when co-located, enabling better modularity and performance.

## üöÄ Features

- Go-native implementation of all Bookinfo services
- Modular deployment using Service Weaver
- Easier debugging and testing without relying on HTTP communication between services
- Compatible with both monolithic and distributed execution modes

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Go 1.22.4
- [Service Weaver CLI](https://serviceweaver.dev/docs/getting-started.html)
- Docker (optional, for containerized execution)
- Kubernetes (optional, for distributed deployment)

### üì¶ Running Locally

To run the application locally with your custom deployment flow:

1. **Build the application binary**

   This will compile the Service Weaver application and generate the binary at the project root:

   ```bash
   go build -o customkube ./customkube-dir

2. **Deploy using your configuration file**

    ‚úÖ Make sure you are authenticated with Docker Hub

    This step builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub based on the config.yaml:

   ```bash
   ./customkube deploy config.yaml


3. **Apply the generated Kubernetes manifests**

    Once the image is pushed, apply the Kubernetes YAML manifests generated by the previous command:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ./weaver-manifests/
